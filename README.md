# Malware_Analysis_Tool
A malware analysis tool using python 3

The OTX API key can be obtained from the AlienVault website by creating an account and subscribing to one of their plans. Once you have a valid account, you can generate an API key by going to the OTX Dashboard, selecting the "API" tab, and following the instructions to create a new API key.

The code will still work without the OTX API key, but the following lines of code will not produce any result:

_otx = OTXv2(OTX_API_KEY, server='https://otx.alienvault.com/')
result = otx.get_indicator_details_full(IndicatorTypes.FILE_HASH_MD5, hash_md5)
print("Alienvault Result:\n",result)_

This is because these lines of code use the OTX API to retrieve information about the file hash using the API key. Without the API key, these lines of code will not be able to access the OTX API and will not produce any results. However, the rest of the code that does not depend on the OTX API key will still execute successfully.
